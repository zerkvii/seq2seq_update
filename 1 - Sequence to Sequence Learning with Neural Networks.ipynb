    "# 1 - Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series we'll be building a machine learning model to go from once sequence to another, using PyTorch and torchtext. This will be done on German to English translations, but the models can be applied to any problem that involves going from one sequence to another, such as summarization, i.e. going from a sequence to a shorter sequence in the same language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first notebook, we'll start simple to understand the general concepts by implementing the model from the [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are *encoder-decoder* models, which commonly use a *recurrent neural network* (RNN) to *encode* the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a *context vector*. We can think of the context vector as being an abstract representation of the entire input sentence. This vector is then *decoded* by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating it one word at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/seq2seq1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above image shows an example translation. The input/source sentence, \"guten morgen\", is passed through the embedding layer (yellow) and then input into the encoder (green). We also append a *start of sequence* (`<sos>`) and *end of sequence* (`<eos>`) token to the start and end of sentence, respectively. At each time-step, the input to the encoder RNN is both the embedding, $e$, of the current word, $e(x_t)$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $h_{t-1}$, and the encoder RNN outputs a new hidden state $h_t$. We can think of the hidden state as a vector representation of the sentence so far. The RNN can be represented as a function of both of $e(x_t)$ and $h_{t-1}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_t = \\text{EncoderRNN}(e(x_t), h_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using the term RNN generally here, it could be any recurrent architecture, such as an *LSTM* (Long Short-Term Memory) or a *GRU* (Gated Recurrent Unit). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have $X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\\}$, where $x_1 = \\text{<sos>}, x_2 = \\text{guten}$, etc. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is usually either initialized to zeros or a learned parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the final word, $x_T$, has been passed into the RNN via the embedding layer, we use the final hidden state, $h_T$, as the context vector, i.e. $h_T = z$. This is a vector representation of the entire source sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have our context vector, $z$, we can start decoding it to get the output/target sentence, \"good morning\". Again, we append start and end of sequence tokens to the target sentence. At each time-step, the input to the decoder RNN (blue) is the embedding, $d$, of current word, $d(y_t)$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $s_{t-1}$, where the initial decoder hidden state, $s_0$, is the context vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$, i.e. the initial decoder hidden state is the final encoder hidden state. Thus, similar to the encoder, we can represent the decoder as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_t = \\text{DecoderRNN}(d(y_t), s_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the input/source embedding layer, $e$, and the output/target embedding layer, $d$, are both shown in yellow in the diagram they are two different embedding layers with their own parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the decoder, we need to go from the hidden state to an actual word, therefore at each time-step we use $s_t$ to predict (by passing it through a `Linear` layer, shown in purple) what we think is the next word in the sequence, $\\hat{y}_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}_t = f(s_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The words in the decoder are always generated one after another, with one per time-step. We always use `<sos>` for the first input to the decoder, $y_1$, but for subsequent inputs, $y_{t>1}$, we will sometimes use the actual, ground truth next word in the sequence, $y_t$ and sometimes use the word predicted by our decoder, $\\hat{y}_{t-1}$. This is called *teacher forcing*, see a bit more info about it [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/teacher-forcing-for-recurrent-neural-networks/). \n",
    "\n",
    "When training/testing our model, we always know how many words are in our target sentence, so we stop generating words once we hit that many. During inference it is common to keep generating words until the model outputs an `<eos>` token or after a certain amount of words have been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our predicted target sentence, $\\hat{Y} = \\{ \\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, ..., \\hat{y}_T \\}$, we compare it against our actual target sentence, $Y = \\{ y_1, y_2, ..., y_T \\}$, to calculate our loss. We then use this loss to update all of the parameters in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be coding up the models in PyTorch and using torchtext to help us do all of the pre-processing required. We'll also be using spaCy to assist in the tokenization of the data."

    "- `input_dim` is the size/dimensionality of the one-hot vectors that will be input to the encoder. This is equal to the input (source) vocabulary size.\n",

    "\n",
    "We aren't going to discuss the embedding layer in detail during these tutorials. All we need to know is that there is a step before the words - technically, the indexes of the words - are passed into the RNN, where the words are transformed into vectors. To read more about word embeddings, check these articles: [1](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/word-embeddings-transform-text-numbers/), [2](http://p.migdal.pl/2017/01/06/king-man-woman-queen-why.html), [3](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/), [4](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/). \n",

    "The embedding layer is created using `nn.Embedding`, the LSTM with `nn.LSTM` and a dropout layer with `nn.Dropout`. Check the PyTorch [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) for more about these.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that the `dropout` argument to the LSTM is how much dropout to apply between the layers of a multi-layer RNN, i.e. between the hidden states output from layer $l$ and those same hidden states being used for the input of layer $l+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `forward` method, we pass in the source sentence, $X$, which is converted into dense vectors using the `embedding` layer, and then dropout is applied. These embeddings are then passed into the RNN. As we pass a whole sequence to the RNN, it will automatically do the recurrent calculation of the hidden states over the whole sequence for us! Notice that we do not pass an initial hidden or cell state to the RNN. This is because, as noted in the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LSTM), that if no hidden/cell state is passed to the RNN, it will automatically create an initial hidden/cell state as a tensor of all zeros. \n",

    "As we only need the final hidden and cell states (to make our context vector), `forward` only returns `hidden` and `cell`. \n",

The first layer will receive a hidden and cell state from the previous time-step, $(s_{t-1}^1, c_{t-1}^1)$, and feeds it through the LSTM with the current embedded token, $y_t$, to produce a new hidden and cell state, $(s_t^1, c_t^1)$. The subsequent layers will use the hidden state from the layer below, $s_t^{l-1}$, and the previous hidden and cell states from their layer, $(s_{t-1}^l, c_{t-1}^l)$. This provides equations very similar to those in the encoder.\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember that the initial hidden and cell states to our decoder are our context vectors, which are the final hidden and cell states of our encoder from the same layer, i.e. $(s_0^l,c_0^l)=z^l=(h_T^l,c_T^l)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then pass the hidden state from the top layer of the RNN, $s_t^L$, through a linear layer, $f$, to make a prediction of what the next token in the target (output) sequence should be, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}_{t+1} = f(s_t^L)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The arguments and initialization are similar to the `Encoder` class, except we now have an `output_dim` which is the size of the vocabulary for the output/target. There is also the addition of the `Linear` layer, used to make the predictions from the top layer hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the `forward` method, we accept a batch of input tokens, previous hidden states and previous cell states. As we are only decoding one token at a time, the input tokens will always have a sequence length of 1. We `unsqueeze` the input tokens to add a sentence length dimension of 1. Then, similar to the encoder, we pass through an embedding layer and apply dropout. This batch of embedded tokens is then passed into the RNN with the previous hidden and cell states. This produces an `output` (hidden state from the top layer of the RNN), a new `hidden` state (one for each layer, stacked on top of each other) and a new `cell` state (also one per layer, stacked on top of each other). We then pass the `output` (after getting rid of the sentence length dimension) through the linear layer to receive our `prediction`. We then return the `prediction`, the new `hidden` state and the new `cell` state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: as we always have a sequence length of 1, we could use `nn.LSTMCell`, instead of `nn.LSTM`, as it is designed to handle a batch of inputs that aren't necessarily in a sequence. `nn.LSTMCell` is just a single cell and `nn.LSTM` is a wrapper around potentially multiple cells. Using the `nn.LSTMCell` in this case would mean we don't have to `unsqueeze` to add a fake sequence length dimension, but we would need one `nn.LSTMCell` per layer in the decoder and to ensure each `nn.LSTMCell` receives the correct initial hidden state from the encoder. All of this makes the code less concise - hence the decision to stick with the regular `nn.LSTM`."

However, if we did something like having a different number of layers then we would need to make decisions about how this is handled.

Do we only use the context vector from the highest layer? Etc.\n",
